# Simple Snake Game in C

Made using SDL in Windows 10 with mingw-w64 x86_64.

You'll need SDL to compile and run this code. Info about SDL can be found [here](http://libsdl.org/)

This program uses SDL_ttf.h to render fonts and SDL_image.h to render images, both of which must be downloaded separately from SDL.
